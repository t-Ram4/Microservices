Monolithic service Vs Micro service

Monolithic service
When a large number of Enterprise applications hosted/deployed as single web application it is called monolithic service.

Drawbacks of monolithic service:
1. Since everything is packaged as one single EAR/WAR file, if any one application has a performance issue, everything will suffer, there is single point of failure.

2.Difficult to scale up when different applications have conflicting resource requirements

3.Difficult to try with new technology stack.

Microservices
The idea is to split your application into a set of smaller, interconnected services instead of building a single monolithic application. Each service is called micro service.

Benefits of microservices:
1.Flexible--different microservices can be developed in different technologies
2.Reliable-If one feature goes down other features will still work.
3.Scalable- each microservice can be scaled induvidually.

Challenges of microservice
1.Devloping distributed system can be complex
2.Initial implementation of microservices is difficult.
